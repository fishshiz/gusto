# ðŸ¥¡ gusto ðŸ¥¡

gusto is a restaurant reviewing site, guided by Wes Boss' Node.js course. gusto allows users to upload, review and rate various restaurants across the globe. It uses ExpressJS for backend processing, MongoDB for data storage and aggregations, and the Mapbox-gl.js API for store plotting and mapping.

## Technology Overview

I built this site through Wes Boss' Node Course. Since completing the course, I have played with and customized the app further from the course code. The course originally used Google Maps API to plot different stores, but I opted to try Mapbox's mapbox-gl.js API instead. The backend is built in Node.js using Express and MongoDB. I used Pug for view templating and SASS for frontend styling.
